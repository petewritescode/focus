# Focus

A simple Google Chrome extension to block distracting sites, keep you focused and help you get more done.

## What it does

The internet is so full of distractions that it can be hard to be productive. You sit down to work and before you know it you're up to your eyeballs in cat videos and Star Wars memes.

**Focus** will block your go-to time-wasting sites, replacing them with a gentle reminder to get on with your work. It'll also sync itself across any Chrome browser you log into.

When you need a break, just toggle **Focus** off and get your procrastination fix.

## What it DOESN'T do

I'm a simple person and I like simple software. With that in mind there are tons of features that I chose not to add, including:

* Tracking of your productive/unproductive time.
* Timers and scheduling to automatically enable or disable the extension.
* Complex rules for managing the URLs you block.

If you're after something with all the bells and whistles, then this isn't the extension for you. If you like clean, easy-to-use software, then give it a try.

## Installation

To run the extension locally:

* Clone this repository to a folder on your local machine.
* Enable Chrome extension developer mode. Open the Chrome menu and select **More tools** > **Extensions**. Enable the **Developer mode** toggle in the top right corner.
* Select **Load unpacked** and browse to the folder where you cloned the repo.
* The extension is now installed and ready to use locally.
* If you make any code changes, navigate back to the **Extensions** page and click the refresh icon beneath **Focus**. Note that this will reset the extension and clear the list of blocked sites.

## Usage

After installation, the extension is enabled by default. To begin with there are no blocked sites, so you can browse the web as normal.

To block a site, visit it, click the **Focus** icon and select **"Block domain.com"**. From now on, whenever you visit that site, you'll be stopped from viewing it and be shown a message reminding you that you have more important things to be doing.

To unblock a site, visit it (you'll see the block message), click the icon and select **"Unblock domain.com"**. You'll now be able to visit the site without any interruptions.

To take a break, click the icon and toggle it from ON to OFF.
